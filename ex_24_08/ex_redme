There is a Group going for traking, total members are 16.
Each person has their different level of tracking from 1 to 10.

person_1    Level: 10
person_2    Level: 3
person_3    Level: 4
person_4    Level: 3
person_5    Level: 9
person_6    Level: 10
person_7    Level: 8
person_8    Level: 10
person_9    Level: 9
person_10   Level: 6
person_11   Level: 7
person_12   Level: 5
person_13   Level: 6
person_14   Level: 7
person_15   Level: 4
person_16   Level: 5

Write a code to get three team with each team having equal level(Total of all team member).
i.e. Team 1 having `n` person with total level `N` then other team should have equal or nearest level number Like `N+1` or `N-1` and members like `n-1` or `n+1`.

You have to divide all level eqaully to each team, any team should not have all higher level members or all lover level members or all midium level.

This code should not return same output every time.

Expected Output should be look like below example

Group: { Team_1: { person_1: 10, Person_16: 5, ..., Person_14: 7}, 
         Team_2: { person_4: 3, Person_10: 6, ..., Person_6: 10},
         Team_3: { ... } 
       }


Note: 
-> You have to create a new directory with your name in directiry of relavent date and exercise. Lik etoday you will create your directiry in ex_24_08 dir.
-> Your code/files should be in your directiry.
-> Follow the naming convention for the ruby file like `persone_name_<date>_<month>_<day>.rb` and you have to add three screenshots of output.
